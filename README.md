# AidDesk (aka "itDemoApp")
A copy of my project just in case I need it or lose it.
Public so I can share it with others.

# Dependencies
Visual Studio *should* request you install these components upon setting up this repository, but just in case here they are:
- VS C++ Development Tools (C++ 14 Standard)
- Windows SDK (created using W10 SDK 10.0.20348.0)

# Notes
- Needs to be certified in order to install app on devices other then building machine (not included)
